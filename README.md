Code files for Wasserstein-Constrained Trust Region Optimization for
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. 

All files are stand-alone, and should compile without any separate argumentation. Files represent the differential game environment, ablation study setup, and varying agent case. 

Note: Hyperparameters may need to be modified for correct experiment replication.
