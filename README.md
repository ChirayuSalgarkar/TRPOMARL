This repository contains the implementation of **W-MATRPO** (Wasserstein Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization) with **CAATR** (Coordination-Aware Adaptive Trust Region) mechanism, as described in the paper: Wasserstein-Constrained Trust Region Optimization for
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. 

All files are stand-alone, and should compile without any separate argumentation. Files represent the differential game environment, ablation study setup, and varying agent case. 


### Requirements
```bash
python >= 3.7
numpy >= 1.19.0
scipy >= 1.5.0
matplotlib >= 3.3.0
pandas >= 1.1.0
```

Note: Hyperparameters may need to be modified for correct experiment replication.
